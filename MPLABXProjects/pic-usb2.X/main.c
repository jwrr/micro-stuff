    main.c

  @Summary
    This is the generated main.c using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs.

  @Description
    This source file provides main entry point for system initialization and application code development.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.170.0
        Device            :  PIC24FJ1024GB610
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.61
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v5.45
