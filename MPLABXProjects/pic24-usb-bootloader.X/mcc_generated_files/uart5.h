    uart5.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the UART5 driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for UART5.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.170.0
        Device            :  PIC24FJ1024GB610
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.61
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.45

    This type specifies the status of the hardware receive or transmit.
    More than one of these values may be OR'd together to create a complete
    status value.  To test a value of this type, the bit of interest must be
    AND'ed with value and checked to see if the result is non-zero.

    This returns the transmitter and receiver status. The returned status may 
    contain a value with more than one of the bits
    specified in the UART5_STATUS enumeration set.  
    The caller should perform an "AND" with the bit of interest and verify if the
